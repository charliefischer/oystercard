# Oyster Cards

This programming problem will be solved through the use of TDD. First, we will deconstruct the User Stories into Features and Messages, and construct the Domain Model.

## User Stories

> I want money on my card

> I want to add money to my card

> I don't want to put too much money on my card

> I need my fare deducted from my card

> I need to touch in and out

> I need to have the minimum amount for a single journey

> I need to pay for my journey when it's complete

> I need to know where I've travelled from

> I want to see to all my previous trips

> I want to know what zone a station is in

> I need a penalty charge deducted if I fail to touch in or out

> I need to have the correct fare calculated

## TDD Process

Next, we will construct Feature Tests in IRB, then the Unit Tests in RSpec. For each feature, we will write the test, then plan in pseudocode, then construct the code, and test until it passes the relevant tests. Then, we will pivot to the next feature.
